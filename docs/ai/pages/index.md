# Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This section contains notes and resources related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, including hardware, programming, and parallel computing concepts. It primarily draws from my **UTSA AI Hardware and Programming** course but applies to broader AI hardware topics.

## Topics Covered
- **[Hardware and Programming](hardware.md)**
    - Covers fundamentals relevant to AI, but not limited to AI.
    - **[Memory Hierarchy Design](memory.md)**
    - **[Parallel Computing](parallelism.md)**
- **[Neural Networks](neural.md)**
    - Concepts and implementation details for training and running neural networks efficiently.
- **[Nvidia's Jetson Nano](jetson.md)**
    - Notes and experiences using Nvidiaâ€™s Jetson Nano for AI and edge computing applications.


## Resources

- Notes are mainy derived from **Dr. Chen Pan's** Hardware and programming course at **UTSA**. Instructor Email: chen.pan@utsa.edu
