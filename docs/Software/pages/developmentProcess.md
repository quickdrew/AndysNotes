# Software Development Flow (Embedded Systems)

This page details a typical **build and deployment process** in embedded software development, including the roles of **linker files** and **incremental compilation**. While many examples use the GNU toolchain, the concepts below apply to a wide variety of compilers and IDEs (e.g., ARM Compiler, Keil, IAR, XC8, etc.) across vendors like **STM32**, **Cypress (Infineon)**, and **Microchip**.

## Overview of the Build Process

1. **Preprocessing**  

      - The preprocessor handles directives like `#include` and `#define` in your C/C++ source files.  
      - Produces expanded source files (often named `.i` or `.ii`).

2. **Compilation**  

      - Converts the preprocessed source code into assembly (internally or explicitly).  
      - Produces **object files** (`.o`, `.obj`) containing machine code for each module.

3. **Assembly (if separate)**  

      - If you have raw assembly code or if your build toolchain treats assembly as a distinct step, the assembler converts `.s` files into object files.

4. **Linking**  

      - Combines all object files into a **single executable** (or firmware image) using **linker files** (also called **linker scripts**, **scatter files**, or **linker command files**, depending on the toolchain).  
      - Resolves symbol references (e.g., function names, global variables) and places code/data in specific memory sections.

5. **Hex/Bin Generation**  

      - Many embedded tools produce a `.hex`, `.bin`, or similar file to be loaded into the microcontroller’s non-volatile memory (Flash).

6. **Flashing/Programming**  

      - The final image is written to your device’s memory (e.g., Flash) using a hardware programmer/debugger (e.g., ST-Link for STM32, PSoC Programmer for Cypress, MPLAB IPE for Microchip, or generic JTAG/SWD).

7. **Debugging**  

      - Tools like **GDB**, **Arm Debugger**, **IAR C-SPY**, or **Keil µVision** allow you to step through code, set breakpoints, and inspect memory/registers on the target hardware.

## Linker Files (Linker Scripts / Scatter Files)

In embedded systems, **linker configuration files** are crucial for defining how compiled code and data map into the microcontroller’s memory. Different toolchains have different naming conventions:

- **GNU ld**: `linker.ld` or `.ld` scripts  
- **Arm Compiler** (Keil): Scatter files (`.sct`)  
- **IAR**: `.icf` (IAR Linker Configuration File)  
- **Microchip**: Linker scripts for XC compilers (e.g., `.gld`)

### Memory Regions
Most linker files specify the sizes and addresses of **Flash** (program memory) and **RAM** (data memory). For example:

```ld
MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
  RAM  (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}
```

### Sections
Code and data sections (e.g., .text, .data, .bss, .rodata) are placed in the corresponding memory regions. For instance:
```ld
SECTIONS
{
  .text : {
     *(.text)
     *(.text*)
     ...
  } > FLASH

  .data : {
     *(.data)
     *(.data*)
     ...
  } > RAM AT > FLASH
  ...
}
```

By customizing these files, you control where code and variables reside—critical for ensuring the program fits within the microcontroller’s memory constraints and meets performance requirements (e.g., running time-critical code from RAM).

## Incremental Compilation

**Incremental compilation** is a build strategy where only changed source files (and their dependents) are recompiled, rather than recompiling the entire codebase. This concept applies across a variety of toolchains and IDEs:

**How It Works**

1. The build system checks file timestamps or hashes (e.g., Make, CMake, vendor IDE projects).  
2. If only a single `.c` file is modified, only that file (and any files depending on it) are recompiled.

**Why It’s Important for Embedded**

- **Faster Iterations:** Large projects (e.g., STM32, PSoC, or Microchip-based) can be slow to compile from scratch.  
  Incremental builds let you test changes more rapidly.

- **Efficiency:** Reduces CPU usage and the time you spend waiting in the edit-compile-flash-debug cycle.

**Potential Pitfalls**

- **Dependency Tracking:**  Misconfigured or missing dependencies can result in stale object files.

- **Linker Script Changes:**  Altering memory layouts or section placements often requires a full rebuild to ensure everything is placed correctly.

## Best Practices for Embedded Builds

1. **Keep Code Modular**

      - Break your application into multiple modules, each with its own responsibility.  
      - This helps the build system isolate changes and recompile only what’s necessary.

2. **Use a Robust Build System**

      - CMake, Meson, Makefiles, or IDE-based solutions (Keil, IAR Embedded Workbench, MPLAB X) all support incremental builds.  
      - Ensure your system is correctly configured so unchanged modules are skipped.

3. **Maintain a Clean Linker Configuration**

      - Document memory regions and section mappings clearly.  
      - Update if you switch MCUs (e.g., going from an STM32F4 to STM32F7, or from PSoC 4 to PSoC 6).

4. **Enable Compiler Optimizations Wisely**

      - **For Debug**: Use lower optimization (e.g., `-O0`, `-Og`) to preserve debugging symbols and structure.  
      - **For Release**: Use higher optimization (e.g., `-O2`, `-Os`) or vendor-specific flags for performance/size gains.

5. **Test Early and Often**

      - Automated tests, static analysis, and continuous integration help catch bugs before they hit hardware.  
      - Regular flashing and real-device tests ensure performance and reliability in actual operating conditions.
