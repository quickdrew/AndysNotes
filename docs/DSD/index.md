# Digital System Design

Digital System Design (DSD) focuses on creating and implementing digital systems using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL. It involves designing, simulating, and optimizing combinational and sequential circuits for tasks such as data processing, communication, and control. DSD bridges the gap between theoretical logic design and practical hardware implementation, enabling the development of complex digital systems like processors, controllers, and FPGA-based solutions.

I worked on several engaging projects for the Nexys A7 Board, focusing on tasks such as handling inputs from buttons, switches, and PWM signals. These projects showcase computations and outputs via hex displays, VGA, and PWM control. You can download a zip file containing all the projects here:
