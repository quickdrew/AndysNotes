# Transistors

This guide offers simple guidelines to help you decide when to use BJTs versus FETs based on your circuitâ€™s needs.

## BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)

**Use When:**

- You need linear amplification with a high current gain.
- Your circuit benefits from well-established biasing methods.
- Low-power switching is required (e.g., driving relays).

**Key Points:**

- BJTs are current-driven.
- They excel in applications where predictable performance is important.
- Best suited for lower-frequency, current-based amplification.

## FETs (Field-Effect Transistors)

**Use When:**

- Fast switching and low power consumption are critical.
- High input impedance is needed, such as in voltage amplification or digital circuits.
- Your design involves high-frequency or low-noise applications.

**Key Points:**

- FETs are voltage-controlled.
- They offer high switching speeds and low conduction losses.
- Ideal for interfacing with digital logic due to minimal current draw.
