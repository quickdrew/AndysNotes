## Oscilloscope

### Probes

Oscilloscope probes connect the circuit under test to the oscilloscope. A typical probe consists of a **probe head**, **flexible cable**, and a **BNC connector** for oscilloscope input. The probe tip includes attachments like a spring-loaded hook for better contact and a ground connection (alligator clip).

**Types of Oscilloscope Probes**

1. **Passive Probes** â€“ The most common type, available in **1Ã—** (low-frequency, low-voltage) and **10Ã—** (high-frequency, high-voltage) configurations.  
2. **Active Probes** â€“ Include transistors and amplifiers, requiring power. Suitable for high-frequency, low-capacitance applications.  
3. **Differential Probes** â€“ Measure voltage between two points instead of ground. Ideal for floating measurements.  
4. **Current Probes** â€“ Detect magnetic fields from current flow and convert them to voltage. Used for non-intrusive current measurement.  

**Passive Probes: Ideal vs. Real**

An **ideal** probe would have infinite bandwidth and zero attenuation, but real probes have frequency-dependent behavior.  

- **1Ã— Setting**: Used for signals <10 MHz and voltages <1V. Low-pass filter effect due to oscilloscope input capacitance.  
- **10Ã— Setting**: Reduces amplitude by 10Ã—, making it better for high-voltage, high-frequency signals. Compensation cancels out oscilloscope capacitance.  

**Probe Compensation**

Probe capacitance must be adjusted to match the oscilloscopeâ€™s internal capacitance for accurate measurements. Poor compensation results in distorted waveforms.  
**Steps:**  

1. Connect the probe to the oscilloscopeâ€™s compensation terminal.  
2. Adjust the probeâ€™s capacitance using the small screw near the probe head until a clean square wave is displayed.  
3. Always compensate when switching probes or using different oscilloscope channels.

**Setting 1Ã— & 10Ã— Probes**

Most measurements use **10Ã— probes**. Ensure the oscilloscope matches the probe setting:  

- Some models autodetect 10Ã— if the probe has a metal detection pin.  
- Otherwise, manually adjust the oscilloscope settings.  

**Probe Loading Effect**

Probes affect circuit behavior through **input resistance** and **input capacitance**:  

- **Input resistance** slightly reduces the measured signalâ€™s amplitude.  
- **Input capacitance** loads the circuit, impacting rise times at high frequencies.
