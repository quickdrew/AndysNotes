### Quanta and Fields
This is a collection of notes I've taken while reading [Quanta and Fields by Sean Carroll](https://www.amazon.com/Quanta-Fields-Biggest-Ideas-Universe/dp/0593186605), much of the details are expanded on using other resources but the general framework was derived from Sean Carroll.
