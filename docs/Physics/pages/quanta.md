# Introduction 

This is a collection of notes I've taken while reading [Quanta and Fields by Sean Carroll](https://www.amazon.com/Quanta-Fields-Biggest-Ideas-Universe/dp/0593186605), unless refrenced otherwise, assume all information (keep in mind his words are being interpreted by a layman) was derived from Sean Carroll.


# Wave Function

## A Brief History of the Development of the Wave Function
### Early Wave Theories and Foundations

#### Light as a Wave
- **Christiaan Huygens (1678)**: Proposed the wave theory of light, suggesting that light travels as waves, contrary to Isaac Newton's particle theory.
- **Thomas Young (1801)**: Demonstrated light's wave nature through the double-slit experiment, revealing interference patterns.
- **Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1816)**: Expanded on Huygens' principle, mathematically explaining diffraction and interference.

#### Electromagnetism and Light
- **Michael Faraday (1831)**: Introduced the concept of electromagnetic fields, showing the interplay between electricity and magnetism.
- **James Clerk Maxwell (1861–1865)**: Unified electricity, magnetism, and optics with Maxwell's equations, proving light to be an electromagnetic wave.

### Atomic Models and Discrete Energies

#### The Atom and Subatomic Discoveries
- **John Dalton (1803)**: Proposed that matter is composed of indivisible atoms.
- **Dmitri Mendeleev (1869)**: Developed the periodic table, emphasizing the discrete properties of elements.
- **J.J. Thomson (1897)**: Discovered the electron, introducing subatomic particles to atomic theory.

#### Rutherford’s Contributions
- **Ernest Rutherford (1911)**: Conducted the gold foil experiment, leading to the nuclear model of the atom with a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons. This model raised questions about electron stability and atomic spectra.

### The Quantum Revolution

#### Blackbody Radiation and Quantization
- **Max Planck (1900)**: Solved the blackbody radiation problem by introducing energy quantization: $E = h \nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\nu$ is the frequency.
- **Albert Einstein (1905)**: Explained the photoelectric effect using quantized light particles (photons), supporting the wave-particle duality of light.

#### Atomic Spectra and Discrete Energy Levels
- **Niels Bohr (1913)**: Introduced the Bohr model, explaining hydrogen's spectral lines via quantized electron orbits.

### Matter Waves and the Schrödinger Wave Function

#### Wave-Particle Duality
- **Louis de Broglie (1924)**: Proposed that matter exhibits wave-like behavior, with a wavelength $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$, where $p$ is momentum.

#### Schrödinger’s Equation
- **Erwin Schrödinger (1926)**: Developed the wave equation to describe quantum systems. The wave function $\psi(x, t)$ represents the quantum state of a particle and evolves according to:
  $$
  i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi
  $$
  where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator. Schrödinger's work explained atomic phenomena such as electron orbitals.

### Probabilistic Nature of Quantum Mechanics

#### Interpretation of the Wave Function
- **Max Born (1926)**: Interpreted $\psi$ as a probability amplitude, with $|\psi|^2$ giving the probability density of finding a particle in a given state. This marked a departure from deterministic classical mechanics.

#### Complementarity and Uncertainty
- **Werner Heisenberg (1927)**: Formulated the uncertainty principle, limiting the simultaneous measurement of properties like position and momentum.
- **Niels Bohr**: Advocated for complementarity, asserting the dual wave-particle nature of quantum systems.
